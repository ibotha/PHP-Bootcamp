The vector class handles Vectors in 3d space.

An instance can be contructed from an array of distinct key-value pairs:
new Vertex( array( 'x' => 1.00, 'y' => 2.40, 'z' => 2.40, 'w' => 2.40 ));

Each of thes values also have one function named:

get_v()

Where 'v' is the variable name, that wil get the desired value.

vec->get_x();

defaults:
x, y, z, w:	0

any values

x, y, z, w constitutives are converted to floats.
Any other use is undefined behaviour.

The class provides the following methods :

Vector   add( Vector $rhs );
Adds each color constitutive and returns a new Vector instance.

Vector   sub( Vector $rhs );
Substracts each color constitutive and returns a new Vector instance.

Vector   mult( $f );
Multiplies each color constitutive by factor $f and returns a new Vector
instance.

float    magnitude ();
returns the total length of the vector.

Vector   normalize ();
returns a new vector of length 1 that points in the same direction as
the original
