The Camara class manages the rasterization pipeline from world->NDC

The Camera constructor requires an array with these key-value pairs
$cam  = new Camera( array( 'origin' => $vert,
						   'orientation' => $R,
						   'width' => 640,
						   'height' => 480,
						   'fov' => 60,
						   'near' => 1.0,
						   'far' => 100.0) );
where 'origin' is a vertex and 'orientation' is a matrix that represents the
rotation of the Camera, 'width' and 'height' are the viewports width and height
respectively. 'fov' is the desired field of fiew and the near and far planes are
defined by the 'near' and 'far' fields respectively.

Methods

Vertex watchVertex(Vertex $v);
converts a vector into NDC space and Returns a new Vector.

setOrigin(Vertex $o);
resets the camera's origin to 'o' Returns nothing;

setRotation(Matrix $R);
resets the camera's Rotation matrix to 'R' Returns nothing;

setProjection( array(	'width' => 640, 'height' => 480, 'fov' => 60,
'near' => 1.0, 'far' => 100.0));
creates a new projection matrix for the camera
(see constructor for value alignments). Returns nothing;
